# About

Based on all the social media posts and eBird reported sightings, I feel like I'm the only one who hasn't spotted a snowy owl yet this year. This got me thinking -- am I looking in the right spots?

As it turns out, Milwaukee is not a bad spot to be on the lookout for a snowy owl. That said, it seems my odds would greatly improve if I were to take a jaunt up to Portage or Douglas county.
